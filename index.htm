      <h1>Usain Bolt</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Usain St. Leo Bolt, OJ, CD, OLY (/ˈjuːseɪn/; born 21 August 1986) is a retired Jamaican sprinter,<br>
        widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. He is the world record holder in the 100 metres, 
        200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay.
      </p>
      <p>
        An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m 
        titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016).<br>
        He also won two 4 × 100 relay gold medals. He gained worldwide fame for his double 
        sprint victory in world record times at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, <br>
        which made him the first person to hold both records since fully automatic time became mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        An eleven-time World Champion, he won consecutive World Championship 100 m, 
        200 m and 4 × 100 metres relay gold medals from 2009 to 2015,<br>
        with the exception of a 100 m false start in 2011. He is the most successful male athlete of 
        the World Championships. Bolt is the first athlete to win four World Championship titles in the 
        200 m and is one of the most successful in the 100 m with three titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bolt improved upon his second 100 m world record of 9.69 with 9.58 seconds in 2009 – the biggest 
        improvement since the start of electronic timing. He has twice broken the 200 metres world record, 
        setting 19.30 in 2008 and 19.19 in 2009. He has helped Jamaica to three 4 × 100 metres relay world records, 
        with the current record being 36.84 seconds set in 2012. Bolt's most successful event is the 200 m, with 
        three Olympic and four World titles. <br>
        The 2008 Olympics was his international debut over 100 m; he had earlier won numerous 200 m medals 
        (including 2007 World Championship silver) and held the world under-20 and world under-18 records for the event until
         being surpassed by Erriyon Knighton in 2021.

        <h3>Usian Bolt</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname "Lightning Bolt", 
        and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, 
        BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year (three times), and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (four times). 
        Bolt was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2016. Bolt retired after the 2017 World Championships, <br>
        when he finished third in his last solo 100 m race, opted out of the 200 m, and pulled up injured in the 4×100 m relay final.
      </p>
      
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
       <p>
        Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt in Sherwood Content,
        a small town in Jamaica. He has a brother, Sadiki, and a sister, Sherine. His parents ran the local grocery store 
        in the rural area, and Bolt spent his time playing cricket and football in the street with his brother,
        later saying, "When I was young, I didn't really think about anything other than sports." As a child, 
        Bolt attended Waldensia Primary, where he began showing 
        his sprint potential when he ran in his parish's annual national primary school meet. By the age of twelve, 
        Bolt had become the school's fastest runner over the 100 metres distance. 
        Bolt also developed an affection for European football teams Real Madrid and Manchester United.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon his entry to William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt continued to focus on other sports, 
        but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events. 
        Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete, and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt, encouraging him to focus his energy on 
        improving his athletic abilities. The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, 
        including sprinter Michael Green. Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001; 
        he took the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds. McNeil soon became his primary coach, 
        and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally 
        frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and his penchant for practical jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content Seventh-day Adventist Church in Trelawny, Jamaica, with his mother. 
        His mother did not serve pork to him in accordance with Adventist beliefs.
      </p>

      <h2>Early Competitions</h2>
      <p>
        Representing Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal 
        best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, 
        winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.
      </p>
      <p>
        He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, 
        Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s.
        Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness 
        to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals 
        at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from 
        the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil 
        and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s 
        and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s 
        finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, 
        Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James) 
        to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. 
        Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston, 
        along with Jermaine Gonzales, so he could train with the Jamaica 
        Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica.
      </p>

      <h2>Rise To Prominence</h2>
      <p>
        The 2002 World Junior Championships were held in front of a home crowd in Kingston, Jamaica, and Bolt was given a chance to 
        prove his credentials on a world stage. By the age of 15, he had grown to 1.96 metres (6 ft 5 in) tall, 
        and he physically stood out among his peers. He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s, 
        which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round. 
        Bolt's 200 m win made him the youngest world-junior gold medallist ever. The expectation from the 
        home crowd had made him so nervous that he had put his shoes on the wrong feet, 
        although he realized the mistake before the race began. However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, 
        as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves. 
        As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4×100 
        metres and 4×400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively.
